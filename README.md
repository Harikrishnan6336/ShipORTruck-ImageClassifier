# ShipORTruck-ImageClassifier

This project was built as part of my submittion to [TinkerHub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/) Practical AI Bootcamp Selection Task

#### A Binary Image Classifier that can classify images as either Ship or Truck. User can call the API by a POST method with image in base64 string as an input data. The API return the predicted label(either SHIP or TRUCK).

## Problem Statement

Create a binary classifier to classify images of ships and trucks. Deploy the model and share links to code in GitHub and the API. 


### Machine Learning

The dataset required for training the ML model was obtained from CIFAR-10 dataset. Several python programs where used to automate the process of procuring the required images of ships and trucks from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 4000 images where used for training and 1000 images where used for validation in each category. Some images where also procured for testing the trained model.
